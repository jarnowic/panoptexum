# What is Pan\OpTeX/um?

Pan\OpTeX/um is a project that implements the \OpTeX/ format into Pandoc. Many \OpTeX/ users
have expressed their desire to be able to convert documents to and from \OpTeX/ using Pandoc.
Currently only the writer is implemented, that means that you can use Pandoc to convert
documents to \OpTeX/, but not from \OpTeX/ as of yet.

## Why does it exist?

This project was created as a semestral project at FIT CTU in Prague in the academic year 2023/2024.
